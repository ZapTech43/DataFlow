# FlowController
A Free OpenSource Software for Windows to Watch & Maintain Your Internet Activity 
So I Created this Software For Those Who Had A Laggy Connection So That This program Can Control The Internet Flow
Features :
- **Prioritize Data Flow**
- **Block Data Flow (Incoming & Outcoming Data)**
